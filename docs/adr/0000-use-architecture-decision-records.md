# 0. Use Architecture Decision Records

Date: 2025-10-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the Yes It's Ananias web application grows and evolves, we need a way to document significant architectural and technical decisions. These decisions should be:

- Accessible to all team members and future contributors
- Version controlled alongside the codebase
- Easy to understand with clear rationale
- Immutable once made (new decisions supersede old ones rather than editing history)

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) provide a lightweight format for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard in his article "Documenting Architecture Decisions".

ADRs will be:
- Stored in `docs/adr/` directory
- Named using the format `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md` (e.g., `0001-implement-code-splitting.md`)
- Numbered sequentially starting from 0001
- Written in Markdown format
- Committed to version control with the code

Each ADR will contain:
- **Title**: A short descriptive title prefixed with the ADR number
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Status**: One of proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, or superseded
- **Context**: The issue motivating this decision and any context needed to understand it
- **Decision**: The change we're proposing or have agreed to implement
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult as a result of this decision

## Consequences

### Positive

- Architectural knowledge is captured and preserved
- New team members can understand why decisions were made
- Historical context is maintained even as team members change
- Decision-making process becomes more transparent and thoughtful
- Prevents revisiting settled decisions without new information

### Negative

- Requires discipline to create ADRs for significant decisions
- Adds a small overhead to the decision-making process
- Team needs to agree on what constitutes a "significant" decision worthy of an ADR

### Neutral

- ADRs are immutable; if a decision is reversed, a new ADR supersedes the old one
- The collection of ADRs grows over time, creating a historical record
